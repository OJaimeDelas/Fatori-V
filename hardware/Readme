### `Fatori-V/hardware/Readme`

```markdown
# FATORI-V — `hardware/` (RTL overrides)

This folder is intended for **user-supplied RTL** that overrides or augments
the reference design from `architecture/`.

General expectations:

- Files are standard Verilog/SystemVerilog (`.v`, `.sv`).
- Module names and interfaces must remain compatible with what the reference SoC expects; the build system will not try to “fix up” mismatches.
- The build scripts (see `scripts/build/Readme`) are responsible for overlaying `hardware/` on top of `architecture/` when constructing the RTL tree.

Execution behaviour:

- These files will override the ones in subsequent `(...)/hardware/src/`, or even in other folder structures. In order to correctly do so, the intended final structure needs to be used here.
If a file is meant to be placed (without corrupting anything) in `architecture/submodules/iob_ibex/hardware/src/`, so it should be placed here under `/submodules/iob_ibex/hardware/src/`.
- The files being overwritten will be placed in `Fatori-V/hardware/temp/`, and returned at the end.

> If no hardware overrides are needed, this folder can remain empty.
