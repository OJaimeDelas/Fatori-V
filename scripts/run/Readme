# FATORI-V — `scripts/run/`

Reserved for higher-level run helpers.

This folder is currently a placeholder for future scripts that operate on
multiple runs at once (for example, batch-running all YAMLs in `runs/`,
comparing results across runs, or sweeping a parameter).

At the moment, `fatori-v.py` is the main entrypoint for a single run and does
not use anything from here. When multi-run tooling is added, its scripts and
documentation will live in this folder.
