# FATORI-V — `scripts/common/`

Shared helpers used by all phases.

This folder contains small, side-effect-free utilities that keep the main
scripts simple. It should not contain any run-specific control logic.

## Files and subfolders

- `common_settings.py`
  - Shared defaults for the scripts layer (e.g. logging format, verbosity).
  - May provide small helpers that are truly cross-cutting.

- `yaml_io/`
  - `load_run_yaml.py` — loads a run YAML from `runs/`, applies basic type
    validation and calls the checks in `yaml_checks.py`.
  - `yaml_checks.py` — registry of small consistency checks. Each check
    inspects the full YAML and can enforce rules such as:
      - “If `run.identification.run == "sim"` then `specifics.ibex.regfile`
        must be `"ff"`.”
    New checks can be added here without modifying the rest of the system.

- `logging/`
  - `setup_logging.py` — sets up a consistent logging format and log file per
    run and per phase.

- `svh_writer/`
  - `svh_writer.py` — helpers for generating readable `.svh` files with
    standard headers and indentation.

- `tcl_writer/`
  - `tcl_writer.py` — helpers for generating `.tcl` scripts in a consistent
    style.

## Conventions

- Main scripts should import functions from here rather than re-implementing
  YAML loading, logging setup or file writing logic.
- The modules in this folder should be small and easy to read; any complex
  behaviour belongs in the area-specific folders (`ftm/`, `pblocks/`, etc.).
